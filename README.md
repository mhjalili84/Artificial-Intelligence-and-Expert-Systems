# Artificial Intelligence and Expert Systems Repository

This repository contains the assignments and projects for the course **Artificial Intelligence and Expert Systems**.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main sections:

1. **Assignments**: 
    - This section includes the assignments that were given throughout the course. Each assignment is stored in its own folder, containing the description of the task as well as the code implemented to solve the problems.

2. **Projects**: 
    - This section contains the projects that were worked on as part of the course. These projects are more extensive and demonstrate the application of AI techniques and expert systems in real-world problems.

## Files

- The **Assignments** folder contains Jupyter Notebook files (`.ipynb`) where solutions to the course assignments are implemented.
- The **Projects** folder includes the code for different AI projects, demonstrating key concepts such as machine learning, search algorithms, and knowledge representation.

## Usage

You can explore and execute the Jupyter Notebook files for assignments directly in your browser using platforms like **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**.

To get started with the projects, clone the repository to your local machine and open the project files in your preferred environment.
